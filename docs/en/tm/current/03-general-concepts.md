## Prioritization of `E55_Type` and `P2_has_type` Over New Classes and Properties

CIDOC CRM is meant to facilitate the integration of heterogeneous cultural heritage data. As a result, the entities it offers are intentionally general in scope so that they can be used by professionals from various specialized heritage disciplines. To ensure a model's effectiveness, the technological and human resources necessary to its development, implementation, and maintenance should be kept to a minimum. This is not only done by limiting the field of expertise it represents (Bruseker 2017, 25), but also avoiding the inclusion of patterns that address *technological* rather than *informational* imperatives (Gruber 1995, 910) by relying on the reuse of pre-existing classes and properties to limit the resources allocated to the creation, documentation, and maintenance of new ones. Yet, because complex concepts (e.g. relationships, techniques, etc.) encompass a variety of facets and characteristics, it is sometimes necessary to further qualify classes in order to facilitate the recording and querying processes. Although the creation of new classes and properties is encouraged by some authoritative institutions, it leads to a bulkier model (hence complexifying the recording process) and a larger number of classes to handle (thus complicating practitioners' queries). The use of a vocabulary to categorize generic entities is thus becoming indreasingly widespread because it requires less resources to rely on external vocabularies than to maintain and manage specialized entities internally (Doerr & al. 2020, xxxviii). Moreover, the use of external vocabularies facilitates interoperability between models as the reconciliation of specialized entities amongst different models is more complicated than that of high-level entities. It also enables organizations to rely on a skillset their professionals already have (i.e. vocabulary management). 

Hence, it appears preferable (and most often doable) to specify entities by using `E55_Type` rather than create new sub-classes and sub-properties. Should this need arise, CHIN intends to work in cooperation with the CRM SIG (or any other committee managing a relevant CIDOC CRM extension) to develop new entities rather than create homemade and local classes and properties.

In addition to this consideration, when several `E55_Type` of different kinds are attached to the same entities, another level of `E55_Type` designates the first `E55_Type` with a second `E55_Type` "metatype" which is used to easily retrieve comparable information at the querying stage.

## Differences Between `E39_Actor`, `E21_Person` and `E74_Group`

Most heritage data pertaining to individuals or groups centers around the *creators* of artefacts and, as such, the Actors facet is centered around the `E39_Actor` class, which ‚Äúcomprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible‚Äù [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E39 Actor)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). There are two subclasses to `E39_Actor:` `E21_Person`, which comprises real persons; and `E74_Group`, which accounts for any type of gathering or organisation of `E39_Actor` acting collectively. As stated in CIDOC CRM, "a gathering of people becomes an `E74_Group` when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together" [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E74 Group)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). As linked.art points out, the class `E39_Actor` ‚Äúmight be used when it is not certain whether the actor is a Person or an Organisation or Group‚Äù [(linked.art 2019b)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#linked-art-2019b).

Some datasets might contain data pertaining to both actors and groups in a single field; in such a case, the use of the `E39_Actor` super-class rather than of its sub-classes is possible (although such a practice should be avoided in order to maintain an efficient mapping process, and cleaning the data would be both preferable and more effective in the long term). For more details on this, please refer to the [Appendix F: Discussions, The Differences Between E39 Actor, E21 Person, and E74 Group](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/appendix-f-discussions#discussion-the-differences-between-e39-actor-e21-person-and-e74-group). 


## Semantic Differences Between Contents, Labels, Notes and Comments, and Descriptive Texts

There are various ways to link a literal data to an entity using different properties, each of which is intended to represent a specific type of human-readable statement. Therefore, it is important to assign the adequate properties to resources.

Heritage data can generally be classified into three kinds of strings explained below: 

*   Labels
*   Annotations and comments
*   Literal content

### Labels

Labels are used to provide a human-readable version of a resource‚Äôs content in addition to its URI, as well as to handle data in several languages (i.e. labelling a piece of information as being in French or in English for example). They are rendered with the property `rdfs:label`.

<a name="007_Pattern_Labels_p"></a>007_Pattern_Labels_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:200px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=007_Pattern_Labels_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D17oAGG4vgPUkCf0Nu3eOVwyMy4swS90a8%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

For example, if the occupation of an artist is documented using the AAT and has the URI [`http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300411314`](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300411314), the ‚Äúartist painters‚Äù label should be added so that humans can understand what that occupation is without going to the Getty website. Another example would be in the case of birth events where concatenation mechanisms (at the mapping stage) can provide useful descriptive labels such as ‚ÄúBirth of Jean Paul Riopelle"; that way, the function of the node is easily understandable to humans.


| üö©  *Important Information*<br/><br/>Labels can be attached to any resource across the target model but will not be displayed in the diagrams to facilitate readability. |

### Annotations and Comments

Annotations to specific pieces of data‚Äîrendered by the CIDOC CRM `P3_has_note` property or by the [`rdfs:comment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_comment) property in RDF‚Äîare used to describe or comment on a specific resource. 


<a name="008_Pattern_AnnotationsComments_p"></a>008_Pattern_AnnotationsComments_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:300px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=008_Pattern_AnnotationsComments_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1pI5Q8RfR8pKTsOM-fZD0dBwe9Z5ThBKL%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>


`P3_has_note` is used to annotate extra information regarding the submissioner's *content* once the mapping process is completed (e.g. "the image URL is not valid/working"). If the note comes from the dataset itself, the [Curatorial Note](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/descriptive-information#curatorial-note) pattern must be used. For its part, `rdfs:comments` is used to add comments with regards to *classes* and *properties*. Both `P3_has_note` and `rdfs:comments` make statements *about* the resource‚Äôs content and *do not comprise* its content. For example, a `P3_has_note` applied to an `E33_Linguistic_Object` annotates the latter‚Äôs text, but does not include it (i.e. it does not contain the `E33_Linguistic_Object` content). 

| üí°  Example: <br/><br/>"Woodwork Construction Ltd." based its name on the owner's previous company name, an information that could be added through an annotation (`P3_has_note`). | 

<a name="009_Example_NoteWoodworkCompany_p"></a>009_Example_NoteWoodworkCompany_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:400px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=009_Example_NoteWoodworkCompany_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1j2ssBSw_wLQod0LROH4BxSR12MXomSGM%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

For more details on this, please see [Appendix F: Discussions, Semantic Differences Between Contents, Labels, Notes and Comments, and Descriptive Texts](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/appendix-f-discussions#discussion-semantic-differences-between-contents-labels-notes-and-comments-and-descriptive-texts).

The [**Annotation** Entry Nodes](https://chin-rcip.github.io/collections-model/en/semantic-paths-specification/current/entry-nodes#annotation) (`P3_has_note`) should be used in edge cases when something is too complex and subtle to be adequately accounted for by current patterns, and too specific to warrant the creation of a new pattern. Annotations should not be dismissed entirely, but should be used with caution. In the Woodwork example mentioned above, it would also be possible to use `P130_shows_features_of`. 

In the rare cases when something is really extraneous to the model but not to understanding, `P3_has_note` and `rdfs:comment` are valid choices. 

| üö©  *Important Information*<br/><br/>Unless the creator of the annotation is impacting the model itself by their work, <code>rdfs:comment</code> should not be used and <code>P3 has note</code> should be preferred. |
 

### Literal Content

To represent the linguistic content of a resource‚Äîappellations, biographies or descriptions for example‚Äî`rdfs:comment` or `rdfs:label` are not suitable. Even though CIDOC CRM previously recommended the use of `P3_has_note` to represent content [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E33 Linguistic Object)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015), it is no longer the case as `P3_has_note` ‚Äúis a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CRM constructs. In particular it captures the characterization of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance, etc‚Äù[(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. P3 Has Note)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). To remedy this, CIDOC CRM has developed the `P190_has_symbolic_content` property to associate an instance of `E90_Symbolic_Object` with a representation of its entire content in the form of a string of text [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. P190 Has Symbolic Content)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015).


| üí°  Example: <br/><br/>For example, the biography of Jean Paul Riopelle could have:<br/>- a label "Biography of Jean Paul Riopelle";<br/>- a note from the museum assessing the biography, stating that it has to be revised for example; <br/>- the content of the biography.<br/><br/>From a modeling standpoint, this would look like the following: |

<a name="010_Example_LiteralContentBiographyRiopelle_p"></a>010_Example_LiteralContentBiographyRiopelle_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:400px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=010_Example_LiteralContentBiographyRiopelle_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D10gUM2Jy9dQyNR8WIURdCtRWary6powUw%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

The best way to represent the content of a resource is to follow CIDOC CRM‚Äôs approach rather than to rely on a homemade property that would only be used by CHIN. As is often the case in the LOD context, it is preferable to employ recognized and approved classes and properties rather than create new, ‚Äúsingle use‚Äù ones.

## Mapping problems and `E33_Linguistic_Object`

If the data of the contributing institution is clean‚Äîin other words, if it is not mixing data types and/or contents within single fields‚Äî, CHIN‚Äôs [Pipeline](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W_vsT_Br86BRR92SWEqFX90861Nu3mUTmx_fAyuOE5A) along with the [Semantic Paths Specification](/collections-model/en/semantic-paths-specification/current/introduction) and Target Model will successfully translate it from a relational to a semantic framework.  However, if the input data is poor‚Äîfor example if it mixes different kinds of information within fields or if it contains heterogeneous natural language expressions‚Äî, it will not be possible to map it to semantic standards.

In such a case, a standard semantic mapping solution is to create an instance of `E33_Linguistic_Object` that is typed using `E55_Type` in order to: 


* indicate the general kind of information held by the `E33_Linguistic_Object`; 
* distinguish it from other `E33_Linguistic_Objects` such as biographies. 

The language of the content must also be indicated and the data must be instantiated into an `rdfs:Literal` and connected to the `E33_Linguistic_Object` instance through the `P190_has_symbolic_content` property. The instance of `E33_Linguistic_Object` itself should be linked back to the node that it describes using the `P67_refers_to` property.

<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:400px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=011_Pattern_MappingWithE33LinguisticObject_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1-uzAimbVP_8WtWTXZlU0qUGWu9itlxEj%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

| üí°  Example:<br/><br/>For example, a museum could have recorded the birth of Jean Paul Riopelle with the following value:  "le septi√®me jour du mois d'octobre 1923". Such a value could not be mapped as it is not compliant with XSD:Date format requirements. In order to nonetheless retain this information, an E33 Linguistic Object linked to an E52 Time-span can be created, as shown below: |

<a name="012_Example_MappingWithE33LinguisticObjectRiopelleBirth_p"></a>012_Example_MappingWithE33LinguisticObjectRiopelleBirth_p

| Had the value been "07.10.1923", the dates could have been encoded properly using the XSD:DateTime format, as shown below: |

## PC Classes

In the CIDOC CRM ontology, some properties can be qualified in order to describe more efficiently the nature of the link between two entities. For instance, the property `P14_carried_out_by` can be specified with the role in which an activity is carried out. This is achieved in the ontology by making a statement on a property. For example, the property `P14_carried_out_by` is linked to a vocabulary term defining the role through the property `P14.1_in_the_role_of`. While conceptually such a structure is a logical inference, it causes some problems implementing it in RDF.

The problem is as follows: In RDF, classes can be instantiated, but not properties. In other words, the instance of a class can be the subject or the object of a triple, while the link between those two entities is always properties‚Äô URI. Therefore, if a specific link needs to be qualified (for example that a specific carrying out of an activity is made under a certain role), using the property‚Äôs URI as subject of this qualifying triple would imply that the property itself is always qualified, even in other occurrences of this property. For example, if a role A is used to specify a unique property `P14_carried_out_by` between Actor B and Activity C, other occurrences of that property `P14_carried_out_by` would also  be linked to the role A.

<a name="097a_PC_ClassesExamples_1_p"></a>097a_PC_ClassesExamples_1_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:423px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=097a_PC_ClassesExamples_1_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D11vR6__SHZCNhK0DGOh2jJnetnpp3i28L%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

To remedy this, a technical addition to CIDOC CRM, called Property-Class Specification (or PC), has been developed by the CRM SIG in 2014. In this extension, the properties in question have been reified (in other words they have been transformed into classes) so that instances of those new Property-Class can become the subject of other triples without affecting the rest of the model.

For example, a new class, called PC14_carried_out_by can be used instead of the property `P14_carried_out_by`. An instance of that PC14_carried_out_by can then be specified with a role through the property P14.1_carried_out_by. Because it is the instance of that property class that is used as the subject of that triple, the role only applies to that specific occurrence.
In order to link the two entities‚Äô domain and range of the previous property, two new properties, `P01_has_domain` and `P02_has_range` have been created. Therefore, instead of  having the triple:
```
Actor A ‚Üí P14_carried_out_by ‚Üí Activity
```
With the PC Specification, it is:
```
Actor A ‚Üê P01_has_domain ‚Üê PC14_carried_out_by ‚Üí P02_has_range ‚Üí Activity
```

<a name="097b_PC_ClassesExamples_2_p"></a>097b_PC_ClassesExamples_2_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:443px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=097b_PC_ClassesExamples_2_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1vqJBTUeb3RvLAvADWxUeLt69-TN51_uM%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

The hierarchy of this extension is rather simple. Each new property class is a subclass of a new root class called PC0_CRM_Property. This minimalistic hierarchy, however, causes some problems. First, it does not follow the CIDOC CRM property hierarchy, which means that some of the property Pxx.1, that should normally be inherited to sub-classes, are not. It is the case of `P67.1_has_type` (domain PC67_refers_to) that cannot be used with the property class `PC138_represents`, even though `P138_represents` is sub-property of `P67_refers_to` in CRMbase. Second, PC0_CRM_Property is not a subclass of E1_CRM_Entity, or any other CRMbase entity. This means that the property classes are not semantically linked to CIDOC CRM.

The PC classes that are used throughout the Target Model are:
- PC14_carried_out_by, in the Relationship and the Artefact production patterns
- PC138_represents, in the Visual Item - Mark pattern
- PC144_joined_with, in the Group belonging pattern


## Data Provenance


### Provenance of the Dataset

One of the goals of Actors is to aggregate museum data from Canadian institutions and other sources in a single [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph). To properly differentiate these data and manage questions of factual agreement and disagreement, it is crucial to track data provenance. But, once the data has been aggregated and deposited into a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore)‚Äîa database for the storage and retrieval of RDF triples‚Äîthe provenance of said data is lost (i.e. what institution or person contributed it). Loading RDF data into such a collection thus entails losing the ability to: 

* identify a subset of RDF triples (i.e. to identify their origin);
* determine whether a single triple is asserted once or multiple times (e.g. if a single triple is asserted by separate distinct sources as opposed to several times by a single source, thus asserting it more than once). 

CHIN considers the best way to establish provenance throughout the model is to use Named Graphs rather than the longer, more complex `E13_Attribute_Assignment` pattern (that would have to be repeatedly assigned to triples, each and every time, and would unnecessarily weigh down the model). For more information about this `E13_Attribute_Assignment` pattern, see the [Appendix A: Data Provenance](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/appendix-a-data-provenance).

A [Named Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_graph) is a set of RDF triples that receives a fourth statement (the triples then become quadruples, or quads: `<subject> <predicate> <object> <graphname>`). This enables the treatment of the whole graph as a single entity which can receive attributes such as author, provenance, etc. Each triple within this Named Graph will inherit the graph‚Äôs information. Named Graphs also allow the use of specific subsets of the collected data based on graph identifiers [(Dodds and Davis 2019, 53)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#dodds-and-davis-2019). One of their most useful characteristics is that they enable SPARQL queries within specific subsets of Named Graphs. 

```
 üí°  Example: 

// Example to come when we will have a first dataset \\

```

*To be reviewed - begin*

The granularity of the dataset structure is partly associated with the level at which Named Graph(s) are implemented. CHIN has been discussing whether a provider‚Äôs dataset-based named graph would be better for data provenance documentation and information management or if a more granular record-based named graph would be relevant. To support CHIN‚Äôs research on Named Graph, a survey on their implementation in the CIDOC CRM community was sent out to members of the CRM-SIG mailing list. Based on its result and the final discussion with the Semantic Committee, CHIN has decided to implement named graph at the dataset level for the following reasons:

* It is the most common practice, at least within the CIDOC CRM community.
* It allows a lower technological barrier as not all available softwares and processes might be able to support a more granular record level structure.
* It prevents the issue of ‚Äòborder entities‚Äô, i.e. the shared nodes of multiple entities, for example, the ‚ÄòBirth‚Äô node shared between an Actor and the parents. As all entities (from the same provider) will be placed in one named graph, there would be no concern over whether to which entity the shared node belongs.
* It is not too difficult nor complicated to set a SPARQL query based on CHIN‚Äôs Target Model to retrieve data of a single entity (all triples pertaining to such entity, mainly an Actor or an Object) as provider‚Äôs data will be mapped to the Target Model. As such, it eliminates the concern over the possibility of missing information that might not be included in the query.

CHIN has decided to use only CIDOC CRM's entities to document the provenance data. The actors involved in the process are connected to the dataset creation event through a `PC14_carried_out_by` in order to associate them with their role (`E55_Type`) in the process. From a modeling standpoint, such a collection of data would look like the following: 

<a name="014_Pattern_NamedGraph_p"></a>014_Pattern_NamedGraph_p
<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:600px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=014_Pattern_NamedGraph_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1G2MBh4jcxAXv9YUJ-8MVDzLBaowem4EZ%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>

In the example below, the two main roles that CHIN envisions for the Named Graph provenance data are displayed. Firstly, there is "Creator" which is used to type the `E39_Actor` who converts the provider's data into RDF graph.  Secondly, there is "Provider" which is used to type the `E39_Actor` responsible of the original dataset. The current pattern is scalable if the future process requires new types.

| üí°  Example 1:  <br/><br/>The National Gallery of Canada (NGC)'s data have been mapped to CHIN's Target Model on January 15th 2021. CHIN was in charge of the mapping and the NGC provided the input data. (fictive use case) |

Such Named Graphs can be expressed in various syntaxes such as [NQuads](https://www.w3.org/2009/07/NamedGraph.html#syntax-1), [TRiG](https://www.w3.org/2009/07/NamedGraph.html#syntax-1), or [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#named-graphs), although they cannot be represented in RDF/XML. They are often represented as additional instances to the usual triples (that thus become quads), but can also be represented at the beginning of an RDF file such as in the following example.

Therefore, if the users want to retrieve the provenance data, they will have to include the graph clause in their SPARQL query.

### Record Provenance with Aggregated Contributors

However, the dataset level Named Graph approach is problematic when aggregating data that has already been aggregated. This is the case of [Artists in Canada](https://app.pch.gc.ca/application/aac-aic/description-about.app?lang=en), a bilingual union list that identifies the location of documentation files on Canadian artists. Its data is submitted by specific institutions and its content is managed by the National Gallery of Canada whilst CHIN handles its technological maintenance [(National Gallery of Canada / Mus√©e des beaux-arts du Canada 2019a)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#national-gallery-of-canada-mus√©e-des-beaux-arts-du-canada-2019a); [(National Gallery of Canada / Mus√©e des beaux-arts du Canada 2019b)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#national-gallery-of-canada-mus√©e-des-beaux-arts-du-canada-2019b).

In the case of such aggregated contributors, it is mandatory to have a named graph for the whole contributor in order for users to be able to query specific information from it (for example if someone wants to search only within Artists in Canada).

As those aggregated contributors also document the provenance of their data, it will be necessary to also identify the primary provenance of each entry (i.e. the institution that contributed it to Artists in Canada in the first place). For the purposes of this model an entry corresponds to the institutional record.

The easiest way to document such entries is to create an `E73_Information_Object` ‚Äúrecord‚Äù instance linked to the individual `E39_Actor` it documents through the `P67_refers_to` property. This same `E73_Information_Object` is linked to its record contributor (a different `E39_Actor`) and dated through an `E65_Creation` event.

The same pattern is applied to a ‚Äúrecord‚Äù instance linked to an artefact (`E22_Human-Made_Object`).

### Limits of and Issues with the Named Graph and ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù approach

The Named Graphs combined with a ‚Äúrecord‚Äù approach lacks some of the precision and granularity of the `E13_Attribute_Assignment` pattern (for more information about the `E13_Attribute_Assignment` pattern, see [Appendix A: Data Provenance](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/appendix-a-data-provenance)). As the source is not specified on every triple, it is not possible to express complex information pertaining to specific triples. For example, it is not possible to indicate that a date attribution is uncertain.

Also, this approach records the provenance of the data, but not the documents used by the contributing institutions themselves when documenting their records.

## Challenges When Representing Indigenous Realities 

Actors aims to document creators from Canadian museums. As such, its model must render most, if not all, of the distinctive characteristics of communities across Canada. This includes communities that are typically underserved by traditional models, most notably Indigenous creators. An overview of current models and vocabularies indicates that they typically adopt a western point of view that does not adequately represent the realities of Indigenous Peoples' lives and artefacts. CHIN, in line with Canadian society's reckoning and path towards reconciliation, considers that respect and deference should be observed when it comes to Indigenous practices and beliefs. Museums are increasingly documenting and exhibiting Indigenous artefacts and this will likely lead, in the years to come, to an increased need for structures that encompass Indigenous characteristics. Thus, special attention will be paid to Indigenous conceptions within the model, particularly when it comes to choosing proper terms to label fields and data. Hopefully, this undertaking will better answer the needs of both Indigenous communities and GLAMs.

For more details on this, please see [Appendix F: Discussions, Challenges When Representing Indigenous Realities](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/appendix-f-discussions#discussion-challenges-when-representing-indigenous-realities).


## Dates pattern

The dating pattern is the same throughout the model. In order to facilitate understanding and reading, it will not be reproduced in the rest of the diagrams of this document.

In CIDOC CRM, only `E2_Temporal_Entities` and its subclasses (comprising events), can be situated temporally. This is done through a time-span, modeled with the property `P4_has_time-span` and the class `E52_Time-Span`.

This `E52_Time-Span` can then be delimited (using the `xsd:dateTime` standard) with the use of 4 properties representing specific dates: 

* `P82a_begin_of_the_begin_` indicates that the time-span of the event may at the earliest have started on that date.
* `P81a_end_of_the_begin_`indicates that the time-span of the event has without doubt at the latest started on that date.
* `P81b_begin_of_the_end` indicates that the time-span of the event has without doubt lasted at least until this date.
* `P82b_end_of_the_end_`indicates that the time-span of the event may have lasted until that date.

The diagram below illustrates the differences between these 4 properties (see the [CIDOC CRM documentation](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/guidelines-for-using-p82a-p82b-p81a-p81b) for more information about this):

Because the `P82a_begin_of_the_begin` and `P82b_end_of_the_end` properties are the most encompassing delimiters of the event, it is wiser to use them systematically and to use the properties `P81a_end_of_the_begin` and `P81b_begin_of_the_end` only when we have such precise information that is specified as such.

It is also possible to add qualifiers to dates with the properties `P79_beginning_is_qualified_by` and `P80_end_is_qualified_by` in conjunction with an `rdfs:Literal`. Such qualifiers can include commentaries (e.g. presumed date) or typical qualifiers (e.g. circa, BC, etc.). 

The full date pattern is as follows:
