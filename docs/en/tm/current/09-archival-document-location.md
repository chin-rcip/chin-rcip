Most museums as well as other heritage organisations hold archival records about the creators they document. For example, the [Artists in Canada](https://app.pch.gc.ca/application/aac-aic/description-about.app?lang=en) database documents this information as well as its primary sources. In CIDOC CRM, there is a distinction between information itself and the physical object this information is in (such as a book, a document, etc.). It is therefore necessary to create  an `E22_Human-Made_Object` in conjunction with an `E31_Document` in order to document (with the property `P70_documents`) the `E39_Actor` [institution](/collections-model/en/semantic-paths-specification/current/entry-nodes#archival-document-institution-appellation) which holds the document. This pattern enables the [localisation of the physical archival document](/collections-model/en/semantic-paths-specification/current/entry-nodes#archival-document-place) by linking this `E22_Human-Made_Object` to an `E53_Place` through a `P54_has_current_permanent_location` property. This also enables the recording of its [call number](/collections-model/en/semantic-paths-specification/current/entry-nodes#archival-document-call-number) as an `E42_Identifier` along with a `P1_is_identified_by` property. 

`E73_Information_Object` encompasses a large set of concepts that have an ‚Äúobjectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units‚Äù [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E73 Information Object)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). However, it is also advised that ‚Äúinstances of `E73_Information_Object` of a documentary nature [...] be declared as instances of the `E31_Document` subclass", which is why the latter has been preferred to the former [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E73 Information Object)](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). 

Note that there is a distinction between the physical location of an institution (e.g. the city, address, or building where it is established‚Äîwhich is documented as an `E53_Place`) and the institution itself (i.e. an `E74_Group`).

| üí°  Example:<br/><br/>Artists in Canada indicates that Artexte and the University of Calgary Library both have archival documents about Jean Paul Riopelle. The Artexte archival documents have the call number "410 - RIOPELLE, JEAN PAUL"; the University of Calgary call number is unknown. |
