## Actor Appellation

|---|---|
|**Category**|Entry Node|
|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word(s), number(s), symbol(s) or code(s) by which an entity (personal or corporate) is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation of an actor as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. It is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative. If it is made of the concatenation of numerous parts, it should include all of them (such as honorifics, titles, etc.).|

|**Typical Case(s)**|*Kitwancool*was painted by Emily Carr in 1928. In this case an institution could decide to enter “Emily Carr” in the Actor Appellation field. It would also be possible to use the Actor Appellation Part fields to create an “Emily” Actor Appellation Part (“First Name” in the Actor Appellation Part Type) and a “Carr” Actor Appellation Part (“Last Name” in the Actor Appellation Part Type).<br><br>However, such Appellations should be indicated as Non-Prefered under Actor Appellation Preference so that original names have precedence. This would especially be the case for Indigenous creators who might have been assigned a name or number by Canadian governing bodies in lieu of their own name. In such cases CHIN advises institutions to always prefer the Appellation preferred by the Actor.<br><br>Power Corporation of Canada, headquartered in Montréal, has an important private collection of artworks. Another Actor Appellation could be created for “Power Corp” that is a brand name (under Actor Appellation Type) of Power Corporation of Canada. Its International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is “CA7392391016” and it is traded as “TSX: POW”, both of which could have their dedicated Actor Appellations as well (with their respective Actor Appellation Type being “International Securities Identification Number” and “Stock Symbol”..|
|**Edge Case(s)**|If a war artist was assigned the number “M32 435 C84” (his military registration number), this number would qualify as an Actor Appellation and the Actor Appellation Type would be “Military Registration Number” or “Military ID”. If the War Museum is related to the Department of National Defence or uses these numbers to identify artists, this number would qualify both as an Actor Appellation (the number assigned by the Department of Defence) and as an Actor ID (the same number used by the War Museum).<br><br>The French appellation of the “Power Corporation of Canada” is “Power Corporation du Canada”. An institution wanting to record both these appellations could either create two Actor Appellations (one for Power Corporation of Canada indicated as English in the Actor Appellation Field, and one for Power Corporation du Canada indicated as French in the Actor Appellation Language field) or a single, bilingual one (Power Corporation of Canada/Power Corporation du Canada).<br><br>The same applies to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine Canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if “PCH” is an Actor Appellation with a Actor Appellation Type “Acronym”, it is impossible to assign a single language to the Actor Appellation Language.<br><br>Unknown artists whose cultural affiliation has been determined are often referred to as such (e.g. “Unknown Canadian”)... how unknown artists should be recorded and where should be determined (considering “unknown Canadian” is not an Actor Appellation and the cultural affiliation of the individual can be recorded in the Cultural Affiliation field).<br><br>Whether to classify (artistic, but also others such as companies) collectives (e.g. Gilbert & George, BGL, etc.) as an organisation (using an Actor Appellation) or a group (using a Group Appellation) has not yet been determined. Provided the collective considers itself to be an autonomous artistic entity, it would not suit a Group Appellation considering Group belonging revolves around the multiplicity of entities. The same would apply for trios, etc. (e.g. BGL) as long as the “group” considers itself to be a single autonomous creator. For example, should BGL be recorded under Actor Appellation with the Actor Appellation Types “Acronym” and “Brand Name” (which begs the question: do we allow more than one type on a single Actor Appellation) or under Group Appellation with the members being recorded as Actors with the Actor Appellations “Jasmin Bilodeau”, “Sébastien Giguère”, and “Nicolas Laverdière”?<br><br>Some institutions need to document animals as actors and although the current definition could accommodate this, CIDOC CRM might not? For example, Wojtek was a bear officially enlisted in the Polish army.|

|**Comment(s)**|Bilingually named entities (such as the National Gallery of Canada/Musée des beaux-arts du Canada) should be recorded as two appellations (National Gallery of Canada and Musée des beaux-arts du Canada).|

## Actor Appellation Language

|---|---|
|**Category**|Entry Node|
|**Scope**|This field indicates the natural or technical language the Actor Appellation is written in. This is a qualifying field so that it necessarily relates to an Actor Appellation and there cannot be an Actor Appellation Language without an Actor Appellation.|

|**Typical Case(s)**|Some languages have alphabets that are specific (e.g. Inuktitut) so that determining the Language of the Appellation would not be problematic, for example: “ᕿᓐᓄᐊᔪᐊᖅᐋᓯᕙᒃ” is written in Inuktitut. That said, this does not account for dialects nor for the fact that identifying what alphabet an Actor Appellation is written in might be problematic. This begs the question of whether we should have a field dedicated to character sets/alphabets (e.g. latin, arabic, chinese, etc.).<br><br>Other cases are language-specific versions of a name, such as the Actor Appellation “Léonard de Vinci”, which would have and Actor Appellation Language value of “French”. “Leonardo da Vinci” on the other hand would be harder to classify as it has no intrinsic language, it is simply the name of the Actor (this is demonstrated by the fact that the same Actor Appellation is used both in English and in Italian). The same would apply to groups (e.g. “Aldo” is not specifically French or English, but “Second Cup Café et cie.” is the French equivalent to “Second Cup Coffee Co.”).|
|**Edge Case(s)**|The original appellation of a person is not fundamentally linked to a language (Leonardo da Vinci is “Leonardo da Vinci” both in English and in Italian, although in French he is referred to as “Léonard de Vinci”).<br><br>Any Actor Appellation that is a number would not fit nicely into a Languages Controlled Vocabulary either. For example, “0100101110101101.ORG”, a collective constituted of Eva and Franco Mattes.<br><br>Bilingual considerations apply to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine Canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if “PCH” is an Actor Appellation with a Actor Appellation Type “Acronym”, it is impossible to assign a single language to the Actor Appellation Language. As such, would the Actor Appellation Language accomodate a list of languages as values? The Appellations could also be divided into Actor Appellation Parts with “PCH” having and Actor Appellation Part Type “Affix”, “Canadian Heritage” having and Appellation Part Type “Root” and “Patrimoine canadien” having an Appellation Part Type “Root” as well. This begs the question of the order and manner in which Actor Appellation Parts will be displayed.|

|**Controlled List/Term**|TBD|
|**Potential Error(s)**|TBD|
|**Comment(s)**|Internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminologies (such as ISO 639-3) can be used, and the field accommodates all UTF-8 compliant languages.<br><br>The language of the Actor Appellation can differ from that of the > Actor Appellation Language (for example, the Actor Appellation can be > “ᐃᓱᒪ”, yet the Actor Appellation Language can be “Inuktitut” rather > than “ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ”).<br><br>*Regarding the “Expected Value” link - Lexvo does not have any browse or search capability for identifying languages - you can keysmash into Lexvo and it will generate a URI for "hsdjkhsdhf" without verifying whether this is a recognized language or not. In order to find language URIs on Lexvo (as opposed to terms in a language), you need to look up by ISO-639 code. The ISO-639 Code Tables do not allow any browsing, only free searching, and do not cross-reference to geographic region. So the effort involved in verifying whether languages provided on the FNMIIO spreadsheet are recognized as languages with URIs or have ISO codes is far too much at this stage given that 99.9% of museum data is in English or French. This is something I would come back to once I have complete or near-complete datasets for all other fields.*<br><br>*We have decided to expand the definition of the field to accommodate both natural and technical languages because the limitation that only allowing natural languages would not bring about more meaning. Allowing both accounts for potential “artist names” for examples that would be technical (for example, an artist that would use @ID as their name). This is mostly to be more mindful of potential limit cases.*|
