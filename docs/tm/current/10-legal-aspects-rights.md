* [Legal Aspects (Rights)](#)

Certain data might be subject to legal rights such as in the case of digital reproductions of art or copyrighted documentation of artefacts. It could also be the case of some textual information such as biographies.

Rights management can become very demanding in terms of resources. CHIN has thus decided that, at least until the Objects Facet is launched in LOD, only rights-free and open data will be asked of museums. As such, only rights-free data will be asked of institutions. Therefore, at this stage, there is no need to assign special rights to specific parts of the information provided by museums. Still, it will be possible to add a rights statement to the entire dataset in order to specify that the data is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero (Public Domain)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). 


| ðŸ”Ž  *To Be Discussed* <br/><br/>CHIN is still trying to determine what would be the easiest and simplest way to handle rights with institutions. Is the open and copyright free limitation sufficient or is it too demanding of institutions? What type of export would best suit the needs of institutions in the long term? |


Creative Commons [(Creative Commons 2020)](/target-model/current/bibliography#creative-commons-2020) and Rights Statements [(Rights Statements 2020)](/target-model/current/bibliography#rights-statements-2020) have their own URIs that can be implemented. The only issue is that these licenses are written solely in English, which is a problem considering CHINâ€™s bilingual obligations as a governmental agency.
