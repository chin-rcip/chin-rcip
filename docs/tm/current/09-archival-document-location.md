* [Archival Document Location](#)

Most museums as well as other heritage organisations hold archival records about the creators they document. For example, the [Artists in Canada](https://app.pch.gc.ca/application/aac-aic/description-about.app?lang=en) database documents this information as well as its primary sources. In CIDOC CRM, there is a distinction between information itself and the physical object this information is in (such as a book, a document, etc.). It is therefore necessary to create  an `E22 Man-Made Object` in conjunction with an `E31 Document` in order to document (with the property `P70 documents`) the `E39 Actor`. This pattern enables the localisation of the physical archival document by linking this `E22 Man-Made Object` to an `E53 Place` through a `P54 has current permanent location` property. This also enables the recording of its call number as an `E42 Identifier` along with a `P1 is identified by` property. 

`E73 Information Object` encompasses a large set of concepts that have an ‚Äúobjectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units‚Äù [(Doerr and Ore 2019a, 34)](/target-model/current/bibliography#doerr-and-ore-2019a). However, it is also advised that ‚Äúinstances of `E73 Information Object` of a documentary nature [...] be declared as instances of the `E31 Document` subclass", which is why the latter has been preferred to the former [(Doerr and Ore 2019a, 34)](/target-model/current/bibliography#doerr-and-ore-2019a). 

Note that there is a distinction between the physical location of an institution (e.g. the city, address, or building where it is established‚Äîwhich is documented as an `E53 Place`) and the institution itself (i.e. an `E74 Group`).
